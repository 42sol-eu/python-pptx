## STATUS

This initial push doesn't do much of a practical nature, I've been focused on
getting the scaffolding code sound so I could build out some real
functionality without getting lost in my own code :)

One or two folks wanted to see what I had so far, so here it is. Expect to see
some actual useful functionality in the next month or so, I've got some time
off coming up I'll be using to add some useful end-user features.
