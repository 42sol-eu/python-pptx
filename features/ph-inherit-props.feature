Feature: Placeholder inherits properties
  In order to conveniently access effective placeholder property values
  As a developer using python-pptx
  I need a placeholder to provide property values that reflect inheritance

  Scenario: Master placeholder property values
     Given a master placeholder
      Then I can get the placeholder position
       And I can get the placeholder dimensions
