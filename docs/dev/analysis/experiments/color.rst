Colors appear in various contexts:

* Fill
* Lines
* Gradients
* perhaps others

There are several ways to specify a color:

* sRGB (standard RGB color space, e.g. #3F2C6F)
* scRGB (an RGB color space with a wider gamut than regular RGB)
* HSL (hue, saturation, and lightness) an alternate way of specifying points in
  the RGB color space, using cylindrical coordinates.
