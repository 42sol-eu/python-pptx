Design Narratives
=================

Narrative explorations into design issues, serving initially as an aid to
reasoning and later as a memorandum of the considerations undertaken during
the design process.


XML wrapper classes
===================

Acceptance Criteria
-------------------

``lxml.objectify``:

* satisfies **1. Parsing** completely.

* satisfies **2. Dotted-notation child access** well-enough, and its approach
  is probably more robust in the long run since it is unambiguous.

* The ObjectPath functionality can be used to satisfy **3. Child element added
  on access**, and other more conventional approaches can be devised if
  needed, perhaps something like ``get_or_add(elm, 'p:cSld/p:sldPr/xyz')``.

1. **Parsing**. Full XML tree of part as found in .pptx file can be parsed
   without leaving out any elements or attributes. Elements with a custom class
   are instantiated with that class, all others get the default class.

2. **Dotted-notation child access**. Child elements and attributes can be
   accessed via dotted notation, e.g. ``sp.nvSpPr.cNvPr``.

3. **Child element added on access**. A child element is added to the parent on
   first access if not already present. Note: I might think better of this and
   end up going with convenient but explicit element creation, perhaps
   something like ``xyz.add_abc()`` for explicit add and
   ``xyz.get_or_add_abc()`` for adding if it doesn't exist yet, that could be
   continued like ``xyz.existing_or_new_abc.existing_or_new_def`` for parts of
   the tree that may or may not be present (optional elements) ... needs to
   also

4. **New elements inserted in proper sequence**.  within their parent

5. ... dealing with repeating elements, e.g. ``txBody.p``

6. ... dealing with element groups with tuple cardinality, like ``p.r``,
   ``p.br``


End-user API facade
===================

Sat Jan 26 2013

It might be a design improvement if the end-user API was via a single module
that mediated access to (at least) implementation classes.

... might include:

* Presentation

  * Presentation(path=None) constructor, to use default template
  * .save(path) -- save the presentation as *path*
  * slidemasters attribute (immutable sequence)
  * slides attribute (immutable sequence)

A related possibility is segregating presentation-related parts to a separate
module, perhaps named prs_parts. Any parts that were general to more than one
Open XML document could be placed in a separate module, and parts for WML and
SML could be added in separate modules to fill out the set.


Members
-------

**rId**

   The relationship identifier. Must be a unique xsd:ID string. It is usually
   of the form 'rId%d' % {sequential_int}, e.g. ``'rId9'``, but this need not
   be the case. In situations where a relationship is created (e.g. for a new
   part) or can be rewritten, e.g. if presentation->slide relationships were
   rewritten on ``before_marshal()``, this form is preferred. In all other
   cases the existing rId value should be preserved. When a relationship is
   what the spec terms as *explicit*, there is a reference to the relationship
   within the source part XML, the key of which is the rId value; changing the
   rId would break that mapping.

   The **sequence** of relationships in the collection is not significant. The
   relationship collection should be regarded as a mapping on rId, not as
   a sequence with the index indicated by the numeric suffix of rId. While
   PowerPoint observes the convention of using sequential rId values for
   the slide relationships of a presentation, for example, this should not be
   used to determine slide sequence, nor is it a requirement for package
   production (saving a .pptx file).

**reltype**

  A clear purpose for reltype is still a mystery to me.

**target_mode**

**target_part**

**target_ref**


Design Narrative --- Text API
=============================

TextFrame.delete_text()
-----------------------

* A txBody element must have at least one paragraph element, so this method
  would delete all the paragraphs except one (perhaps the first or last one)
  and remove all its text.

* A <a:p> element is not required to contain any child elements, so could just
  empty it of all children or perhaps leave something like this::

    <a:p>
      <a:endParaRPr lang="en-US"/>
    </a:p>


... text is a fairly complicated bit ... deceptively sophisticated one might
fairly say.

* ... will need both simple and sophisticated ways of dealing with text ...

* Use TextFrame2, apparently it's an enhanced version of legacy TextFrame

    TextFrame2 exposes the new text properties introduced in PPT 2007.

* `TextRange Members`_ page on MSDN Office Interop

.. _TextRange Members:
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.office.interop
   .powerpoint.textrange_members(v=office.14).aspx


Design Narrative --- Full unmarshaling vs. ElementTree
======================================================

... question of whether a full unmarshaling of part XML using something like
pyXB or generateDS is a sensible design option a bit later on after basic
functionality is completed and perhaps scaling becomes more difficult (if it
does) with just using the lxml.ElementTree objects.


Design Narrative --- blob to element to blob life-cycle
=======================================================

* (?) Detecting is_xml for both loaded and new parts (call .partname?)

* (?) What about added binary parts like Image?

* There's a bit of a smell to this in that redundancy of ordering info is
  added to collections. Operations like reordering adding and deleting will
  need to operate on both the collection and the XML.

* I suppose sub-classes can override _blob() if they need to do something
  special.

* add_part(element) methods will need to take care of adding _element for
  their part.


Hypothesis
----------

blob > element > blob lifecycle can be completely handled in BasePart.

xml elements access self._element. Maybe change _load_blob to __load_blob.

::
    **in _load():**

    if self.is_xml:
        self._element = etree.fromstring(pkgpart.blob)
    else:
        self._load_blob = pkgpart.blob

    **in _blob():**

    if self.is_xml:
        return etree.tostring(self._element, ...)
    else:
        return self._load_blob


* If we start with the principle that all operations will be conducted on the
  XML elements and no separate attributes will be stored ...

* We might keep references to parts of the element, but changes to those parts
  are changes to the root reference. So unless we break that, everything
  should work fairly seamlessly.


Slide attributes -- draft list
------------------------------

* overall shape tree transform (not sure what this is exactly)
* shape tree (root group shape)


GroupShape attributes -- draft list
-----------------------------------

* id (slide internal scope I think)
* group_shape_name, top level one might be slide name
* transform (x, y, cx, cy, etc.)
* shapes (sp, groupshape, pic, some others)


Shape attributes -- draft list
------------------------------

* id (slide internal)
* name (assigned)
* locks (like no grouping)
* placeholder (id="0" is title, and id defaults to 0, so title if no id
  specified)
* text


Open issues parking lot
=======================

* Principle: No loaded bits will be removed from the XML. I'm thinking that
  means that unless we keep track of which are loaded and which are new, that
  drives the decision to work with the XML in-place.

* ... there's the issue of whether library will be used to fully unmarshal
  existing documents and manipulate them. The challenge of writing brand-new
  documents is simpler I think.

* There is some irresolution around a possible distinction between part
  classes and element classes, particularly a possible distinction between
  a part class and it's root element. Something to continue to noodle.


Design Narrative -- Using Sphinx for library documentation
==========================================================

Conundrum: How to use the autodoc selectively so a pleasing layout is
produced.

Important things include::

   .. automodule:: <module_name>

   .. autoclass:: <class_name>

   .. autofunction:: <function_name>

The key to using these features is the :members: attribute. If:

You donâ€™t include it at all, only the docstring for the object is brought in:
You just use :members: with no arguments, then all public functions, classes,
and methods are brought it that have docstring. If you explictly list the
members like :members: fn0, class0, _fn1 those explict members are brought.


Design Narrative -- Part blob lifecycle
=======================================

Recorded: 2012-12-24 11:46 PM

* pptx.packaging.Part stores part content as blob

* if pptx.presentation.Part persists the blob and serves it back to
  pkg.marshal, round-trip should work

* presentation parts that unmarshal blob need to provide a blob property that
  marshaling can use to access part content.


TODO:

* (/) refactor pptx.packaging.Part.load to unconditionally save blob
* (/) locate part.write_element and replace with write_blob
* (/) remove element attribute from pptx.packaging.Part


* Simplify packaging module by working only with blobs whenever possible

* write_element is handy for items that packaging works on directly, like cti
  and rels items. So no urgent need to get rid of it, just always write parts
  as blobs.

* presentation.Parts need ._blob attribute in their interface so packaging can
  uniformly access contents for marshaling.

   Rationale:

   * _blob is required for binary objects, so at least some parts must have
     that attribute.

   * A need to determine whether to call _blob or element to access part
     contents would complicate marshaling and unmarshalling code.

   * A static part doesn't need to access its blob, it can just carry it until
     it's needed for marshaling.

* principle: packaging.Part always gets and stores blob (lowest common
  denominator).

* Need a blob round-trip between package to model and back


Design Narrative -- Model Load
==============================

Recorded: 2012-12-22 11:01 PM

* __loadwalk()


Requirements
------------

* All parts are constructed exactly once.

* All part relationships are created and populated with target part.

* (?) What to do with package relationships?

* Parts of types with a custom Part-subclass are instances of the custom
  sub-class.

* Custom sub-class instances are triggered to perform unmarshalling once the
  part and its relationships are completely loaded. It might be sensible to
  wait and do this once all parts and relationships are loaded, with a second
  walk or similar implementation.

* Could be that propagating control flow rather than recursive might work
  best, so that local context is kept local to the package or part.
