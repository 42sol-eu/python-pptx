Summary
=======

* An image part is distinct from a picture element that appears on a slide or
  other part. An image part is like an email attachment that can be displayed
  in many parts of the deck and corresponds to a distinct image file such as
  image1.png. A picture element is a placement of that image on one or more
  visual parts such as a slide, slide master, or slide layout. A theme can
  also include a picture (although I've yet to discover just how :).

  Also note that a single image part can appear on multiple visual parts while
  the image part (and therefore its image file) is stored only once in the
  package.
